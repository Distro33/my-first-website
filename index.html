         Since i was a kid i was interested with technology. I played games all day and got scolded by mom for playing all day and not doing school work like all the other little gamers.
         After figuring out how to hack games with my phone with some sketchy apps. I felt almost(it wouldnt work on some big branded games) like i could do anything. I started CyberSecurity which flopped
         because of my laziness and not wanting to study even more than i already had to. I dropped out from the school i was in and went to pursue my dreams with a public school.(my grades were too low for a private school)
         After 3 years i got done with middle school and went to high school where i learned how to learn about coding because teachers aren't really that good. I somehow did not suck at it and casually became the top student.
         I got my first Thanks document from school for having high grades right after my mom died. After feeling like the universe is trying to haha me i got my stuff together and started learning more. I learned how to make good websites
         with a not so good website.(wix) I got a job and dropped going to the gym for now.(yeah i like going to the gym) I started cooking like i used to(yeah i also like cooking) but had to stop chopping wood because there weren't any wood to chop.(yeah i like chopping wood)
         I also did designing and photography. I know Javascript, Css, Html, C#, Python(a little), Discord.Js, Git, MySql and Java. I think there were few more but i can't remember all of them.
